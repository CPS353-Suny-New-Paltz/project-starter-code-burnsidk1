# Software Engineering Project Starter Code

The chosen computation for the project is a Collatz Sequence. This sequence takes in a positive integer and then returns a string of numbers. The output is dependent on whether or not the previous number or original input is even or odd. If the number is even, it is divided by 2. If the number is odd, it is multiplied by 3 with the addition of 1. This sequence continues until the final output is 1.
